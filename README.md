## Bower

[Bower](http://bower.io/) depends on [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/). 

It's installed globally using npm:

```
npm install -g bower
```

Also make sure that [git](http://git-scm.com/) is installed as some bower
packages require it to be fetched and installed.

### Usage

Much more information is available via `bower help` once it's installed. This
is just enough to get you started.

Using the dependencies listed in the current directory's bower.json

```
bower install
```
